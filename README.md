# Wodk Web App #

A PHP/JS web application framework starter kit.

Version 1.0.5

There are a lot of great web application frameworks available. This package contains two of them, one for PHP called [Limonade][] and another for JS called [Backbone.js][]. It's not a framework itself, but instead a skeleton to use these other great products. 

In addition to these frameworks, a few other products are included. A great template engine called [Twig][], a utility JavaScript library called [Underscore.js][] (a requirement for Backbone.js), the ever useful [jQuery][] (also a requirement for Backbone.js). In addition, three utility classes are also included: 
* [Wodk/DB][wdb], a subclass of [MySQLi][], 
* [Wodk/Logger][wlog], a real simple logger, 
* [Wodk/TwigExtensions][wtx], a couple extensions to the Twig template engine

All of this has been wrapped with a base structure to make [getting started][] very easy.
