# Wodk Web App

A PHP/JS web application framework starter kit.

Version 1.1.x

There are a lot of great web application frameworks available. This package contains two of them,
one for PHP called [Limonade][] and another for JS called [Backbone.js][]. It's not a framework
itself, but instead a skeleton to use these other great products. 

In addition to these frameworks, a few other products are included. A great template engine called
[Twig][], a utility JavaScript library called [Underscore.js][] (a requirement for Backbone.js),
the ever useful [jQuery][] (also a requirement for Backbone.js). In addition, three utility classes
are also included as part of the [Wodk Library][]: 

* [Wodk_DB][], a subclass of [MySQLi][], 

* [Wodk_Logger][], a real simple logger, 

* [Wodk_TwigExtensions][], a couple extensions to the Twig template engine

All of this has been wrapped with a base structure to make [getting started][] very easy.
