# Wodk Web App

A PHP/JS web application framework starter kit.

Version 1.1.x

There are a lot of great web application frameworks available. This package contains two of them,
one for PHP called [Limonade][] and another for JS called [Backbone.js][]. It's not a framework
itself, but instead a skeleton to use these other great products. 

In addition to these frameworks, a few other products are included. A great template engine called
[Twig][], a utility JavaScript library called [Underscore.js][] (a requirement for Backbone.js),
the ever useful [jQuery][] (also a requirement for Backbone.js). To finish things off there is the
utility library [Wodk][] that includes a simple [database abstraction][] over [MySQLi][]; a very
simple [logger][]; and a few [Twig extensions][].

All of this has been wrapped with a base structure to make [getting started][] very easy.
